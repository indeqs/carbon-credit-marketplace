The project is a blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate the issuance, monitoring and trading of carbon credits. Utilizing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, the government can issue carbon credits to registered companies, track their carbon emissions in real-time through integrated sensors and enable peer-to-peer trading of surplus credits. This system ensures transparency, reduces administrative costs and enhances regulatory compliance in efforts to combat climate change.

## Key Features:
1. Smart Contract-Based Carbon Credit Issuance: Automated issuance of carbon credits to registered companies by the government.
2. Real-Time Emission Monitoring: Integration with IoT sensors to track carbon emissions from various company locations.
3. Transparent Trading System: A decentralized marketplace for companies to trade surplus carbon credits.
4. Automatic Penalty and Compliance System: Fine calculations for companies exceeding their carbon credit limits and alerts for sensor malfunctions.
5. Immutable Record Keeping: All transactions and emission data are securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability.
